### Challenge Targets:
* Implement the following HTTP API calls by reading the data from employee.json (added in this project) and display the result in a web browser. 
* Use Java with Spring to implement the back-end API. You may use any front-end library / frameworks for displaying the data on the browser. Please provide us with all the files / instructions we will need to run your code.
* The challenge has to be completed for only three days upon receipt of this instruction. If you have any questions do not hesitate to reach out to us for clarification.
* We are looking at the correctness of the code, the handling of edge cases, and how well it is factored (reusable / extensible) including commenting. We are also looking for a professional web page to display the data.
